# By visiting the official Jenkins website, you can find installation steps for various operating systems. 
 However, for this repository, I will be installing Jenkins on Ubuntu.

# As we are creating jenkins master-agent architecture we will need 2 VM's. 

# Master :

jenkins official site :
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu

1. sudo apt update

2. sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre

3. sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

4. echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

5. sudo apt-get install jenkins


# After installing jenkins on master server,add port 8080 in security group to access jenkins.

# Agent

1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre

# There is no need to install jenkins on agent node but we have to install java as 
all the jenkins jobs will run on agent node. java is dependency to work with jenkins.
