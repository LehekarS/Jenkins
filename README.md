# What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). 
It helps developers automate software development processes like building, testing, and deploying applications.

# Key Features:
Automation – Reduces manual work by automating build and deployment tasks.
Extensibility – Supports a wide range of plugins for different functionalities.
Scalability – Can be distributed across multiple machines to improve performance.
Integration – Works with various version control systems like Git, SVN, and more.
Customization – Can be tailored to fit different workflows and environments.

# Jenkins Architecture & Usage
Jenkins follows a Master-Slave Architecture, which consists of:

# Jenkins Master :

Controls the overall workflow.
Assigns tasks to worker nodes (agents/slaves).
Manages job scheduling and monitoring.

# Jenkins Agent (Slave):

Executes assigned tasks like building and testing applications.
Can run on different machines to distribute workloads.

# Why Use This Architecture?

Load Distribution – Helps in parallel execution of jobs for better efficiency.

Scalability – Allows adding more agents as project complexity grows.

Resource Optimization – Different agents can be configured for different environments (Linux, Windows, etc.).

# Advantages of Jenkins

Free & Open-Source – No licensing cost.

Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Extensive Plugin Support – Integrates with multiple tools and services.

Easy Configuration – Simple web-based UI for job setup.

Fast Feedback Loop – Detects and resolves issues early in development.

Active Community Support – Regular updates and improvements.
